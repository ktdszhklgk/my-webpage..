    <h1>Ultracentrifuge</h1>
    <p>An ultracentrifuge is a powerful laboratory instrument used to separate components of a mixture based on their density. It works by spinning samples at extremely high speeds, generating strong centrifugal forces that can separate particles, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and cells, from a solution.</p>

    <h2>Key features include:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Speed</strong>: It can reach speeds of up to 100,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) or more, leading to accelerations that can exceed 1,000,000 times gravity.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotors</strong>: Different types of rotors (fixed-angle, swinging bucket, etc.) can be used depending on the sample and separation needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications</strong>: Commonly used in biochemistry, molecular biology, and clinical laboratories for tasks like purifying proteins, isolating organelles, and separating lipids.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety</strong>: Due to the high speeds and potential hazards from sample materials, ultracentrifuges are designed with safety features to contain any failures.</li>
    </ul>
